How children learn their native language must be one of the most debated topics studied and discussed by linguists, psychologists, and cognitive scientists. There are numerous factors that influence childrenâ€™s language acquisition process and their level of competence as well as performance.
One particular aspect of language acquisition is semantic competence, which is the focus of this study. We create different environments, in which a model (language learner)
acquires the language. These environments are corpora, with different measurable and controllable linguistic features that affect the training of the models. We then conduct tests to examine and quantify the correlation of some of these features to the semantic competence of the language learner. We find out one specific feature, i.e. concreteness influences language acquisition.
